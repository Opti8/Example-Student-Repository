# How to Format Your Exercise Answers


The format for exercises is as follows:

	# Chapter Title
	# Exercises
	
	## Exercise Number
	> Exercise Content
	
	Response
	
	## Exercise Number
	> Exercise Content
	
	Response
	
For example:

# Mastering Git Part 1
# Exercises

## Exercise 1
> Create a new empty Git repository using git init. Create a new file called “README.md.” Add it and commit it to the repository using an appropriate commit message.

## Exercise 2

> Create a .gitignore file that ignores all JPEG images. Copy a JPEG image to your repository’s directory. Try adding and committing this file. What happens? Can you think of a way to modify your .gitignore so that you can still add this file while still ignoring other JPEGs?

Your answer goes here.

# Additional Information

1.  Some exercises are hands on examples without output.  In such cases, you do not have to put said exercises in the coursework.

2.  The number you should assign the exercise (exercise 1, exercise 2, etc) may not always be obvious.  This is why we ask you include the content of the exercise as well as a Markdown quote.  What really matters is the instructor can decipher what exercise you are answering.
